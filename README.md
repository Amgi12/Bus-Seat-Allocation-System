# Bus-Seat-Allocation-System

Design and implement a C program to manage bus seat allocations for Redbus. The
program should have the following features:

- Accept bus details (bus number, route, departure time, and number of seats)
- Accept passenger details (name, age, and contact number)
- Allocate seats to passengers based on availability
- Display allocated seat numbers and passenger details
- Handle cancellations and re-allocate seats accordingly

Implement functions for seat allocation, cancellation, and display of allocated seats.
